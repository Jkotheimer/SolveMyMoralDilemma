# SolveMyMoralDilemma (PHIL 181)

This program uses a utilitarianistic theory of morality to help you decide your moral dilemma.<br>
There are hundreds of other theories to go off of that will give you many different answers, <br>
but for the sake of simplicity, this program sums up the positivity rating (ultimate well-being) <br>
that each outcome produces, and tells you to do the thing that produces the most well-being.
